1. useNewUrlParser
Why it exists: MongoDB's older connection parser (the tool that reads and processes the database connection string) had some limitations and bugs.
Purpose: It tells Mongoose to use MongoDB's newer, more reliable connection parser.
Example of Why Itâ€™s Needed:
Old Parser: Might fail to handle special characters (like @, &, or =) in your connection string.
New Parser: Handles these characters correctly, ensuring you can use modern, complex connection strings.

2. useUnifiedTopology
Why it exists: MongoDB previously used multiple separate tools for handling different server setups (e.g., replica sets, sharded clusters). This led to inconsistent behavior and deprecation warnings.
Purpose: It enables a unified way of connecting to the database, improving how Mongoose discovers and connects to MongoDB.
